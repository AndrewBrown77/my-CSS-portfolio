* The article element should be used correctly. Currently, the article with id "Project" is empty and not used appropriately. * The main element should contain the primary content of the document, but it has some misplaced elements and styles that could be better structured. * The links in the navigation menu do not correctly scroll to the corresponding sections because of incorrect IDs and duplicate IDs (e.g., two elements with id="project-3") * Images in the projects section should link to the deployed applications as specified in the requirements. * Avoid using multiple display properties (e.g., display: flex; display: grid; in a selector) on a single element. * Clean up unused or redundant CSS properties to improve readability. * Deployed link is missing and a readme which should consist of a description,screenshot and link to deployed application. You've made a great start on your portfolio project, tackling a complex task with multiple elements. Your effort to include various sections, images, and styles shows a solid understanding of HTML and CSS. Keep experimenting and refining your skills; you're on the right track!~ER

Hi Andrew,

Your effort in creating a portfolio application is commendable! Building a portfolio is an essential step in showcasing your skills and projects. Here are some specific areas where you’ve done well and some suggestions for improvement to help you enhance your project further.

What You’ve Done Well:
Navigation Links:

You’ve included navigation links in your header, which is a great start for a user-friendly interface.

Areas for Improvement:
Add a Real Photo or Avatar:

Include a real photo or avatar of yourself to personalize your portfolio. This helps create a connection with your audience.

Responsive Layout:

Ensure your application adapts to different screen sizes. Use media queries to adjust the layout for various devices.

Improve Project Section Layout:

The first image in your project section should be larger to draw attention. Additionally, ensure each project links to a deployed application or a placeholder if not available.

Complete Navigation Links:

Make sure all sections (About, Work, Contact) are linked in the navigation menu and that each link correctly targets a section on the page.

Consistent and Meaningful Class/ID Names:

Use meaningful class and ID names to improve code readability and maintainability. Follow good practices for naming conventions.

File and Folder Structure:

Organize your files and folders to maintain a clean and manageable project structure.

Quality Comments:

Add comments to your code to explain your logic and the purpose of different sections. This helps others (and yourself) understand the code better.

Descriptive Commit Messages:

Use descriptive commit messages in your Git repository to track changes effectively. This helps in understanding the history and purpose of each change.

High-Quality README:

Update your README to include a high-quality description, screenshots, and a link to the deployed application. This is essential for anyone visiting your repository.

Additional Suggestions:

Mock-Up Functionality:

Ensure your application resembles the mock-up functionality provided in the challenge instructions. Pay attention to layout, styling, and interactivity to match the expected design closely.

Project Titles and Descriptions:

Add titles and brief descriptions to each project to give visitors context about what each project entails.

Final Words:

Andrew, you’re on the right path! Creating a portfolio is a significant step in showcasing your skills and projects. By incorporating the feedback and suggestions above, you can significantly enhance the quality and usability of your portfolio. Keep pushing forward, refining your work, and learning new things. Your effort and dedication will pay off!

Happy coding
